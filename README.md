# Soul EV Spy

Soul EV Spy is an Android application that allows you to read out some useful information out of your 
Kia or Hyundai EV, that you cannot access using the on-board computer or display.

STATUS: BETA: Can collect data from car (via a Konnwei KW-902 Bluetooth OBD-II dongle) and phone gps, 
can retrieve locations of DC quick-chargers, opens Google Maps navigation on click,
stores data on phone or SD card, displays data values on lists, gps and links to google maps route to chargerlocation.
No UI fancyness.

Works on Kia Soul EV with 27 to 30 kWh battery (2014-2018), and reads some data from on Kia Ray EV, Kia e-Niro, Kia eSoul 2020, Hyundai BlueOn EV, Hyundai Ioniq EV and Hyundai Kona EV.

# Informal warning

Before you download and use this software consider the following:
You are interfering with your car and doing that with hardware and software beyond your control (and frankly, for
a large part beyond ours), created by a loose team of interested amateurs in this field. Any car is a possibly
lethal piece of machinery and you might hurt or kill yourself or others using it, or even paying attention to
the displays instead of watching the road. Be extremely prudent!

By even downloading this software, or the source code provided on GitHub, you agree to completely understand this.

Get it from Google Play Store:

If you try this app in your car, I will appreciate an email with the log-files and csv-files (they are in the Download dir, either in Internal Storage, or on the SD card), along with info on car model, trim and year, which dongle you used, and your thoughts of the app, errors or suggestions for improvement. Send the email to soulspy@evranger.com.

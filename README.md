Note: No support for the new Kia Soul EV 2020 (yet)!

# Informal warning

Before you download and use this software consider the following:
you are interfering with your car and doing that with hardware and software beyond your control (and frankly, for
a large part beyond ours), created by a loose team of interested amateurs in this field. Any car is a possibly
lethal piece of machinery and you might hurt or kill yourself or others using it, or even paying attention to
the displays instead of watching the road. Be extremely prudent!

By even downloading this software, or the source code provided on GitHub, you agree to completely understand this.
